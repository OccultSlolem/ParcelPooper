# ParcelPooper

ParcelPooper is a simple TypeScript library that interfaces with various courier APIs. It provides a simple interface for authenticating with the APIs and retrieving tracking and shipping rate information.

Many courier APIs have confusing documentation, so ParcelPooper aims to provide a simple, well documented, and type-safe interface for interacting with them.

The current plan is for ParcelPooper to support the following couriers:

- United States Postal Service (USPS)
- United Parcel Service (UPS)
- FedEx
- DHL

More may come in the future.
